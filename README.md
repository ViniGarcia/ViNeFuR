==========================================================

*Status: Development*

### What is ViNeFuR?

ViNeFuR is a free repository of experimental network functions implemented in several programming languages and frameworks. We aim to provide a myriad of resources for NFV solutions researches. Currently, the ViNeFuR project is the initial state and just network functions developed in Python and Click Modular Router are provided.

### How the functions were developed?

The following resources were used to develop network functions:
1. Python programming language + Scapy library
2. Click Modular Router framework
